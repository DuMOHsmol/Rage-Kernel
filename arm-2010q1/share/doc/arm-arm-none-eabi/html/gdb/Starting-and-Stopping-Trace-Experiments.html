<h4 class="subsection">13.1.8 Starting and Stopping Trace Experiments</h4>

     
<a name="index-tstart-695"></a>
<a name="index-start-a-new-trace-experiment-696"></a>
<a name="index-collected-data-discarded-697"></a>
<dl><dt><code>tstart</code><dd>This command takes no arguments.  It starts the trace experiment, and
begins collecting data.  This has the side effect of discarding all
the data collected in the trace buffer during the previous trace
experiment.

     <p><a name="index-tstop-698"></a><a name="index-stop-a-running-trace-experiment-699"></a><br><dt><code>tstop</code><dd>This command takes no arguments.  It ends the trace experiment, and
stops collecting data.

     <p><strong>Note</strong>: a trace experiment and data collection may stop
automatically if any tracepoint's passcount is reached
(see <a href="Tracepoint-Passcounts.html#Tracepoint-Passcounts">Tracepoint Passcounts</a>), or if the trace buffer becomes full.

     <p><a name="index-tstatus-700"></a><a name="index-status-of-trace-data-collection-701"></a><a name="index-trace-experiment_002c-status-of-702"></a><br><dt><code>tstatus</code><dd>This command displays the status of the current trace data
collection. 
</dl>

   <p>Here is an example of the commands we described so far:

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) <b>trace gdb_c_test</b>
     (gdb) <b>actions</b>
     Enter actions for tracepoint #1, one per line.
     &gt; collect $regs,$locals,$args
     &gt; while-stepping 11
       &gt; collect $regs
       &gt; end
     &gt; end
     (gdb) <b>tstart</b>
     	[time passes ...]
     (gdb) <b>tstop</b>
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-disconnected-tracing-703"></a>You can choose to continue running the trace experiment even if
<span class="sc">gdb</span> disconnects from the target, voluntarily or
involuntarily.  For commands such as <code>detach</code>, the debugger will
ask what you want to do with the trace.  But for unexpected
terminations (<span class="sc">gdb</span> crash, network outage), it would be
unfortunate to lose hard-won trace data, so the variable
<code>disconnected-tracing</code> lets you decide whether the trace should
continue running without <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>set disconnected-tracing on</code><dt><code>set disconnected-tracing off</code><dd><a name="index-set-disconnected_002dtracing-704"></a>Choose whether a tracing run should continue to run if <span class="sc">gdb</span>
has disconnected from the target.  Note that <code>detach</code> or
<code>quit</code> will ask you directly what to do about a running trace no
matter what this variable's setting, so the variable is mainly useful
for handling unexpected situations, such as loss of the network.

     <br><dt><code>show disconnected-tracing</code><dd><a name="index-show-disconnected_002dtracing-705"></a>Show the current choice for disconnected tracing.

   </dl>

   <p>When you reconnect to the target, the trace experiment may or may not
still be running; it might have filled the trace buffer in the
meantime, or stopped for one of the other reasons.  If it is running,
it will continue after reconnection.

   <p>Upon reconnection, the target will upload information about the
tracepoints in effect.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will then compare that
information to the set of tracepoints currently defined, and attempt
to match them up, allowing for the possibility that the numbers may
have changed due to creation and deletion in the meantime.  If one of
the target's tracepoints does not match any in <span class="sc">gdb</span>, the
debugger will create a new tracepoint, so that you have a number with
which to specify that tracepoint.  This matching-up process is
necessarily heuristic, and it may result in useless tracepoints being
created; you may simply delete them if they are of no use.
