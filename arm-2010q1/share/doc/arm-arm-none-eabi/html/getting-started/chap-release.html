          A bug that caused the error <code class="literal">internal compiler error:
	  in get_arm_condition_code</code> when compiling code using
	  64-bit integers has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Improved NEON code generation for 0.0 constants. </b>
          The compiler now generates better code for loading
	  double float 0.0 constants on processors supporting
	  NEON instructions.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect linker-generated functions. </b>
	  A bug that caused some linker-generated functions (including
	  stubs to support interworking from ARM mode to Thumb mode
	  and stubs to implement long branches) to jump to invalid
	  offsets has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>
	  Improved support for debugging <span class="trademark">
	  RealView</span>® programs with inlined functions
	. </b>
	  GDB has been enhanced to better handle debug information for
	  inlined functions contained in binaries produced by the
	  ARM <span class="trademark">RealView</span>®
	  compiler.  Formerly, local variables in inner function
	  scopes would become unavailable at calls to static inline
	  functions.  GDB now also includes inlined functions in the
	  stack trace in binaries produced
	  by <span class="trademark">RealView</span>®
	  versions earlier than 4.0.  In addition, GDB's support for
	  stepping over inline functions in programs built with such
	  compilers has been improved.
	</p><p><b>Long branch fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the linker to generate
	  ARM-mode instructions for long branches on ARM v6-M.
	  The linker now generates Thumb instructions.
        </p><p><b>Improved code generation for <code class="literal">if</code> statements. </b>
	  The compiler can now generate better code for <code class="literal">if</code>
	  statements when the then and else clauses contain similar code.
	</p><p><b>Assembler encoding bug fixes. </b>
          Several bugs in the assembler have been fixed that
	  caused selection of incorrect encodings for some
	  instructions that have multiple encodings.  The
	  incorrect encodings are not believed to have affected
	  runtime behavior but were not in conformance with
	  the canonical encodings specified by the ARM
	  ARM.  The <code class="command">objdump</code> command has also
	  been fixed to decode such instructions correctly.
        </p><p><b>ARMv7-A performance improvements. </b>
	  The compiler has been enhanced to produce faster code for the
	  ARM architecture, particularly for ARMv7-A cores, when compiling
	  using the <code class="option">-O2</code> option.  This results in a
	  significant improvement in performance relative to CodeSourcery's
	  2009q3 releases.
        </p><p><b>Linker performance improvement. </b>
          A bug in the linker that caused applications with many input
	  files to link slowly has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>ARM EABI 2.08. </b>
          The toolchain has been updated to implement ARM EABI 2.08
	  (October 2009).
        </p><p><b>Weak symbols. </b>
	  An assembler bug has been fixed that caused incorrect
	  code to be generated for references to weak symbols when a
	  default definition is also provided in the same file. 
        </p><p><b>GDB shared library support. </b>
	  GDB now supports targets that report loaded shared libraries
	  using the <code class="literal">qXfer:libraries:read</code> Remote
	  Serial Protocol packet.  For more information, see the GDB
	  manual.
	</p><p><b>Optimization of ARM NEON
	<code class="function">vdupq_n*</code> intrinsics. </b>
          The compiler now generates better code for
	  <code class="function">vdupq_n*</code> intrinsics to load
	  particular constants.
        </p><p><b>Linker bug fix for <code class="option">--section-start</code>. </b>
          A linker bug that caused <code class="option">--section-start</code>
	  to fail to work as documented if the section is defined
	  in multiple object files has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>GCC inline assembly bug fixes. </b>
          A bug that caused NEON/VFP registers specified in the
	  clobber list of inline assembly statements to be saved
	  and restored incorrectly has been fixed.  Another bug
	  that caused incorrect code when double-precision or
	  quad-precision registers were specified in the clobber
	  list has also been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Assembler segmentation fault fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the assembler
	  to crash when processing some data filling directives,
	  such as <code class="literal">.fill 0, 0, 0</code>.
        </p><p><b>Linker bug with Cortex-A8 erratum fix. </b>
          A bug in the <code class="option">--fix-cortex-a8</code> linker option,
          which is enabled by default when linking ARMv7-A objects,
          has been fixed.  The bug could cause the linker to generate
          incorrect shared libraries.
        </p><p><b>Improved code generation for Cortex-A5. </b>
          The compiler has been enhanced to provide instruction
          scheduling for Cortex-A5 cores.  To take advantage of this,
          use the <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-a5</code> command-line option.
        </p><p><b>
	  Improved support for debugging <span class="trademark">
	  RealView</span>® programs
	. </b>
	  GDB has been enhanced to handle some debug information
	  contained in binaries produced by the
	  ARM <span class="trademark">RealView</span>®
	  compiler.  Formerly, GDB sometimes crashed on these programs
	  and libraries.
	</p><p><b>Linker script processing improvement. </b>
	  The linker can now automatically place sections that are not
	  mentioned in your linker script.  Previously, it issued
	  the error <code class="literal">no memory region specified for loadable
	  section</code>.
        </p><p><b>Better use of NEON instructions on Cortex-A8. </b>
	  The compiler now generates better code when optimizing for the
	  Cortex-A8 by being less eager to use NEON instructions.
        </p><p><b>Assembler segmentation fault fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the assembler to crash when
          assembling some Thumb-only instructions in ARM mode.  The
	  assembler now gives an error on all incorrect uses of
	  Thumb-only instructions in ARM mode.
        </p><p><b>GCC internal compiler error. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused GCC to crash when
	  compiling some C++ code using templates at
	  <code class="option">-O2</code> or <code class="option">-O3</code>.
        </p><p><b>Linker script compatibility. </b>
	  A bug that caused the linker error <code class="literal">undefined
	  reference to `__cs3_start_asm'</code> has been fixed.
	  The bug applied to projects using a linker script from an
	  older version of Sourcery G++ with a newer CS3 library.
	  
        </p><p><b>
	GCC internal compiler error with <code class="code">optimize</code> attribute. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the compiler to crash
	  when invoked with the <code class="option">-O0</code> or
	  <code class="option">-O1</code> option on code using the
	  <code class="code">optimize</code> attribute to specify higher
	  optimization levels for individual functions. 
        </p><p><b>C++ array initializer optimization. </b>
          The compiler now generates better code for some
	  non-constant array initializations in C++.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id285157"></a>A.1.2. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2010q1-155</h3></div></div></div><p><b>IPSR register. </b>
          A bug in the Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite that caused only five
          bits of the M-profile <code class="literal">IPSR</code> register to be
          displayed in the debugger has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Support for ARM Cortex-M4 cores. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ now includes support for ARM Cortex-M4 cores.
	  Use the <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-m4</code> command-line option.
        </p><p><b>Debugging preprocessed source code. </b>
          A compiler bug has been fixed that caused debug output to
	  erroneously contain the name of the intermediate
	  preprocessed file.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 size optimization improvements. </b>
          The compiler has been enhanced to produce smaller code for the
          ARM architecture, particularly for Thumb-2 mode, when compiling
          using the <code class="option">-Os</code> option.  This results in a
          significant improvement in code size relative to CodeSourcery's
          2009q3 releases.
        </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
	  7.0.50.20100218.  This update adds numerous bug fixes and
	  new features, including improved C++ language support,
	  automatic caching of stack memory, and Position Independent
	  Executable (PIE) support.
	</p><p><b>CS3 program startup behavior revised. </b>
          CS3's model for program startup has been made
	  more uniform across different target profiles.
	  Changes include:
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
	      Execution now consistently begins at hard reset
	      (<code class="function">__cs3_reset</code>) for all profiles.
	      Formerly, the debugger began execution at assembly
	      initialization (<code class="function">_start</code>) instead.
	    </li><li>
	      All profiles now perform the assembly initialization
	      phase, using profile-specific code.  Formerly, simulator
	      and boot monitor profiles skipped this initialization
	      phase.
	    </li></ul></div><p>
	  Most existing programs using customized linker scripts or
	  startup code based on the previous CS3 initialization model
	  should continue to work as before with the new CS3 library.
	  
	  For more details on the CS3 startup model,
	  refer to <a class="xref" href="sec-cs3-startup.html" title="5.2. Program Startup and Termination">Section 5.2, &#8220;Program Startup and Termination&#8221;</a>.
        </p><p><b>CS3 improvements. </b>
	  Several changes have been made to CS3 to make it easier to
	  customize, including improved documentation and additions
	  and corrections to the header file
	  <code class="filename">cs3.h</code>.
	  For details, see <a class="xref" href="chap-cs3.html" title="Chapter 5. CS3&#8482;: The CodeSourcery Common Startup Code Sequence">Chapter 5, &#8220;CS3&#8482;: The CodeSourcery Common Startup Code Sequence&#8221;</a>.
        </p><p><b>GDB asynchronous mode fix. </b>
          GDB can now be used from the command line in asynchronous mode
          with remote targets.  Previously, GDB did not accept user input
          while asynchronous commands (such as
          <code class="command">continue &amp;</code>) were running.
        </p><p><b>GDB interrupt handling bug fix. </b>
	  A bug in GDB has been fixed that caused it to sometimes
	  fail to indicate that the target had stopped after being
	  interrupted.	The bug affected
	   clients using GDB's MI front end.
	</p><p><b>GDB and programs linked with
	  the <code class="option">--gc-sections</code> linker option. </b>
	  GDB has been improved to better handle debug information
	  found in programs and libraries linked with
	  the <code class="option">--gc-sections</code> option.  GDB formerly
	  selected the wrong debug information in some cases,
	  resulting in incorrect behavior when stepping over a
	  function or displaying local variables, for example.
	</p><p><b>GDB memory find bug fix. </b>
	  A bug in GDB's <code class="command">find</code> command has been fixed.
	  The bug caused searches on large memory areas to fail or
	  report matches at incorrect addresses.
        </p><p><b>Debugger errors after loading program. </b>
	  A bug in GDB has been fixed that sometimes caused a GDB internal error
	  
	  after the <code class="command">load</code> command.
	</p><p><b>Frame manipulation bug fix. </b>
          A bug in GDB has been fixed that caused frame manipulation commands
          to report an internal error in some cases when used on arbitrary
          stack frames specified by an address.
        </p><p><b>Read watchpoints bug fix. </b>
          A GDB bug has been fixed that caused watchpoints set to
          trigger on memory reads to be silently ignored in some
          cases.
        </p><p><b>GDB load improvement. </b>
          GDB now automatically initializes ARM Cortex-M devices to
          Thumb mode on the <code class="command">load</code> command.  This is
          helpful, for example, when an incorrect program image was
          previously flashed onto the board, causing it to enter an
          invalid state on reset.
        </p><p><b>Setting thread-specific breakpoints in GDB. </b>
          A bug in GDB has been fixed that caused a syntax error for
          the <code class="command">break
          *<em class="replaceable"><code>expression</code></em> thread
          <em class="replaceable"><code>threadnum</code></em></code> command.
        </p><p><b>Backtracing through ARM M-profile exceptions. </b>
          GDB now supports backtracing through processor exceptions
	  on ARMv6-M and ARMv7-M targets, including Cortex-M3.
        </p><p><b>Backtracing through noreturn functions. </b>
	  A compiler bug that made it impossible to obtain a backtrace
	  through functions declared with the <code class="code">noreturn</code>
	  attribute has been fixed.  This fix makes it possible for the
	  debugger to present a useful stack backtrace for applications
	  that call <code class="function">abort</code>.
        </p><p><b><code class="literal">vcvt</code> assembly bug fix. </b>
          A bug that caused <code class="literal">vcvt.s32.f64</code> instructions
	  to be misassembled as <code class="literal">vcvtr.s32.f64</code> has been
	  fixed.
        </p><p><b>Branches between ARM and Thumb fix. </b>
          An assembler bug that caused incorrect branches
	  between ARM and Thumb code in different sections
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Assembler segmentation fault fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the assembler to crash
	  when processing code containing invalid Thumb-mode instructions
	  such as <code class="literal">ldr r0, 0</code>.  The assembler now produces an
	  error message in such cases.
        </p><p><b>Assembler fix for Thumb-2. </b>
          A bug that caused the assembler to reject some valid Thumb-2
	  <code class="literal">strexd</code> instructions has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>NEON assembler fix. </b>
          The assembler now correctly handles the three-operand form of NEON
	  logic instructions, such as
	  <code class="literal">vorr.i32 q0, q0, #0xff</code>
        </p><p><b>Warning for deprecated instructions. </b>
          The assembler now issues warnings about uses of
	  <code class="literal">swp</code> or <code class="literal">swpb</code>
	  instructions on architectures where they have been
	  deprecated.
        </p><p><b>Additional error checks in the assembler. </b>
          The assembler has been improved to perform
	  a number of additional checks for invalid inputs.
	  In particular, it now diagnoses additional invalid uses of the
	  PC and SP registers, as specified in the ARM documentation.
          The assembler now also rejects invalid NEON alignment qualifiers,
	  such as <code class="literal">vld1.8 {d0}, [r0, :128]</code>
	  and <code class="literal">vld1.8 {q0}, [r0, :256]</code>.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 multiply fix. </b>
          A bug that caused an invalid <code class="code">muls</code> instruction
          to be generated in certain circumstances has been fixed. This
          affected code compiled for Thumb-2, and resulted in an error
          from the assembler.
        </p><p><b>Debug Sprite multiple connections fix. </b>
	  When started with the <code class="option">-m</code> option,
	  the Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite no longer exits if the
	  connection to GDB is lost when sending a response.
	  Instead, it goes back to waiting for another connection.
        </p><p><b>Disassembler bug fix. </b>
          A bug in the disassembler has been fixed that caused incorrect
	  output for data objects, including literal pools and the
	  interrupt vector.
        </p><p><b>Improved code generation for Cortex-A9. </b>
          The compiler has been enhanced to provide better instruction
          scheduling for Cortex-A9 cores.  To take advantage of this,
          use the <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-a9</code> command-line option.
        </p><p><b>Improved NEON code generation. </b>
          GCC's code generation for NEON targets
          (e.g., when compiling with <code class="option">-mfpu=neon</code>)
          has been improved.
          In particular, the compiler can now make use of NEON
          instructions for many 64-bit integer operations.
        </p><p><b>Indirect function call optimization. </b>
          The instruction sequence used to implement calls via a function
          pointer has been improved to give better branch-prediction
          performance on some processors.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 function call optimization. </b>
          The compiler has been enhanced to generate improved code
          on Thumb-2 targets for functions that return via calls to
          other functions.
        </p><p><b>Watchpoint fix. </b>
          A bug in the Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite that sometimes prevented
          watchpoints on Cortex-M targets from functioning has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Optimizer bug fix. </b>
          A bug in GCC that caused internal compiler errors
          at <code class="option">-O2</code> or above has been fixed.  The bug also
          occurred at other optimization levels when
          the <code class="option">-fpromote-loop-indices</code> command-line
          option was used.
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler error fix. </b>
	  A bug that caused an internal compiler error when using
	  <code class="option">-fno-omit-frame-pointer</code> to compile code for Thumb-2
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 internal compiler error fix. </b>
          A bug that caused an internal compiler error when building
          the QT library for Thumb-2 has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect symbol addresses bug fix. </b>
          A bug in the linker that caused it to assign incorrect
          addresses to symbols has been fixed.  The bug occurred when
          the input objects contained sections not explicitly mentioned
          in the linker script.
        </p><p><b>Static constructor and destructor ordering fixes. </b>
          The linker now correctly ensures that static destructors with
	  priorities are executed after destructors without priorities.
	  Another linker bug that caused incorrect static constructor
	  and destructor ordering with partial linking involved
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Linker fix for data-only sections. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the linker to incorrectly mark
	  parts of the output as containing code, rather than data,
	  when linking data-only sections not explicitly tagged as such.
	  The bug resulted in incorrect disassembly.
        </p><p><b>Linker relocation diagnostics. </b>
          A bug that caused the linker to incorrectly diagnose overflows
	  for some valid relocations has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>C++ name-mangling of <code class="type">va_list</code>. </b>
	  The compiler no longer issues <code class="literal">the mangling of
	  'va_list' has changed</code> warnings for references
	  to <code class="type">std::va_list</code> within system header files.

          A GDB bug has been fixed that caused GDB to crash when
          unloading shared libraries or switching executables.
        </p><p><b><code class="option">@<em class="replaceable"><code>FILE</code></em></code> fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed in the processing of
	  <code class="option">@<em class="replaceable"><code>FILE</code></em></code>
	  command-line options by GCC, GDB, and other tools.
	  The bug caused any options in
	  <em class="replaceable"><code>FILE</code></em> following a blank line
	  to be ignored.
        </p><p><b>Preprocessor error handling. </b>
	  The preprocessor now treats failing to find a file referenced
	  via <code class="literal">#include</code> as a fatal error.
	  
        </p><p><b>NEON improvements. </b>
          The compiler now generates improved NEON vector code when
	  copying memory or storing constants to memory using the
	  NEON coprocessor.
	  The compiler also generates better code for
	  accessing data arrays that are not known to have 64-bit alignment.
          In addition, a bug that caused internal compiler errors
          when compiling for Thumb-2 with NEON enabled has been fixed,
	  as has another bug that caused some vector shift NEON operations

        </p><p><b>ELF file corruption with <code class="command">strip</code>. </b>
          A bug that caused <code class="command">strip</code> to corrupt unusual
          ELF files has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>GDB support for Cygwin pathnames. </b>
	  A bug in GDB's translation of Cygwin pathnames has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Compiler errors with <code class="type">float32_t</code>. </b>
	  A bug has been fixed that caused compiler errors when using the
	  <code class="type">float32_t</code> type from <code class="filename">arm_neon.h</code>.
        </p><p><b>Support for ARM Cortex-A5 cores. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ now includes basic support for ARM Cortex-A5 cores.
	  Use the <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-a5</code> command-line option.
        </p><p><b>Static variables and <code class="literal">asm</code>
          statements bug fix. </b>
          A bug in GCC that caused functions containing static variables
          and <code class="literal">asm</code> statements to be miscompiled
          at <code class="option">-O2</code> or above has been fixed.  The bug also
          occurred at other optimization levels when
          the <code class="option">-fremove-local-statics</code> command-line
          option was used.
        </p><p><b>Linker script fixes. </b>
         A bug in CS3 linker scripts for
         
         
         
         <span>simulator</span>
         profiles has been fixed.
         The bug resulted in data memory being too small, which
         sometimes caused the stack to be overwritten during
         initialization, or reduced space for
         <code class="function">malloc</code> to allocate.
       </p><p><b>Warnings for naked functions. </b>
	  A compiler bug that resulted in incorrect warnings about
	  missing return statements in non-void functions declared with
	  the <code class="code">naked</code> attribute has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Optimizer bug fix. </b>
          A bug in GCC that caused functions with complex loop nests to
          be miscompiled at <code class="option">-O2</code> or above has been
          fixed.  The bug also occurred at other optimization levels
          when the <code class="option">-fpromote-loop-indices</code> command-line
          option was used.
        </p><p><b>VFPv4 support. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ now includes support for VFPv4, VFPv4-D16 and
	  NEON-VFPv4 coprocessors.  Use the <code class="option">-mfpu=vfpv4</code>,
	  <code class="option">-mfpu=vfpv4-d16</code> or 
	  <code class="option">-mfpu=neon-vfpv4</code> options, respectively.
        </p><p><b>GCC internal compiler error. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the compiler to crash when
	  optimizing code that casts between structure types and the
	  type of the first field.
        </p><p><b>Flash programming support on Atmel AT91SAM7Sxxx. </b>
	  The Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite now supports flash programming
	  on Atmel AT91SAM7Sxxx when using SEGGER J-Link devices.
        </p><p><b>ELF Program Headers. </b>
          The linker now better diagnoses errors in the usage of
          <code class="literal">FILEHDR</code> and <code class="literal">PHDRS</code>
          keywords in <code class="literal">PHDRS</code> command of linker
          scripts.  Refer to the linker manual for more information.

	  GCC now automatically enables loop unrolling and
	  <code class="option">-fpromote-loop-indices</code> when
	  <code class="option">-O2</code> or <code class="option">-O3</code> is specified.
	  Loop unrolling is limited at <code class="option">-O2</code> to
	  control code growth.  These changes improve performance by
	  more than 5%.
        </p><p><b>VFP assembly mnemonics. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts unified assembly mnemonics for
	  VFP instructions (e.g. <code class="literal">VADD.f32 s0, s0</code>)
	  in legacy syntax mode.
        </p><p><b>ARM Cortex-R4F assembler bug fix. </b>
	  The assembler now correctly recognizes the
	  <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-r4f</code> command-line option to
	  select the Cortex-R4F processor.
        </p><p><b>VFP half-precision extensions. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ now includes support for VFP coprocessors with
	  half-precision floating-point extensions.  This can be enabled
	  with the <code class="option">-mfpu=vfpv3-d16-fp16</code> or
	  <code class="option">-mfpu=vfpv3-fp16</code> command-line options.
        </p><p><b>Optimizer improvements. </b>
	  When optimizing for speed, the compiler now uses improved
	  heuristics to limit certain types of optimizations that may
	  adversely affect both code size and speed.  This change also
	  makes it possible to produce better code when optimizing for
	  space rather than speed.
	</p><p><b>Improved optimization for Thumb-2. </b>
	  GCC now supports instruction scheduling for Thumb-2 code.
	  This optimization is enabled when compiling with
	  <code class="option">-O2</code>, <code class="option">-O3</code>, or
	  <code class="option">-Os</code>, and can improve performance
	  substantially.
        </p><p><b>ARM VFP assembler bug fix. </b>
          The assembler now correctly assembles the 
          <code class="literal">vmls</code>, <code class="literal">vnmla</code> and
          <code class="literal">vnmls</code> mnemonics.  Previously these were
          incorrectly assembled to different instructions.
        </p><p><b>GDB <code class="command">finish</code> internal error. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused a GDB internal error when
	  using the <code class="command">finish</code> command.  The bug occurred
	  when debugging optimized code.
        </p><p><b>Linking objects built without <code class="option">-fPIC</code>
        into shared libraries. </b>
          The linker now gives an error for attempts to link object
          files built without <code class="option">-fPIC</code> or
          <code class="option">-fpic</code> into shared libraries when those
          objects use the ARMv7 <code class="literal">MOVW</code> and
          <code class="literal">MOVT</code> instructions in ways that are unsafe
          in a shared library.  Previously it built a shared library
          that behaved incorrectly when used.
        </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
	  6.8.50.20090630.  This update adds numerous bug fixes and
	  new features, including support for multi-byte and
	  wide character sets and improved C++ template support.
	</p><p><b>New assembler directive <code class="literal">.inst</code>. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts the new <code class="literal">.inst</code>
	  directive to generate an instruction from its integer encoding.
        </p><p><b>GDB and third-party compilers. </b>
	  Some bugs that caused GDB to crash when debugging programs
	  compiled with third-party tools have been fixed.  These
	  bugs did not affect programs built with Sourcery G++.
        </p><p><b>Remote debugging hardware watchpoint bug fix. </b>
          A GDB bug has been fixed that caused hardware watchpoint hits
          to be incorrectly reported in some cases.
        </p><p><b>Internal error in assembler. </b>
	  An assembler bug that caused an internal error when
	  <code class="literal">.thumb</code> or <code class="literal">.arm</code> appears after an
	  invalid instruction has been fixed. 
        </p><p><b>GDB internal warning fix. </b>
	  A GDB bug has been fixed that caused warnings of the form
	  <code class="literal">warning: (Internal error: pc <em class="replaceable"><code>address
	  </code></em> in read in psymtab, but not in symtab.)</code>.
	</p><p><b>Incorrect linker diagnostic removed. </b>
          The linker has been corrected to not emit an error message
          when the load address of an output section with no contents
          overlaps an output section with contents.  This can occur
          in linker scripts that use <code class="code">MEMORY</code> regions and
          <code class="code">AT&gt;</code> to place initialized contents into ROM.
        </p><p><b>Improved bit counting operation. </b>
          The <code class="function">__builtin_ctz</code> built-in function,
          which returns the number of trailing zero bits in a value,
          has been improved to use a shorter instruction sequence for
          ARMv6T2 and later.
        </p><p><b>Out-of-range branch errors. </b>
	  A Thumb-2 code generation defect in the compiler that caused
          <code class="literal">branch out of range</code> errors from the
	  assembler has been eliminated.
        </p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
	  The binutils package has been updated to version
	  2.19.51.20090709 from the FSF trunk.  This update includes
	  numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Linker fix. </b>
          The linker now correctly processes references to undefined
          local symbols.  Such references are treated the same as
          references to undefined global symbols.  Usually object
          files contain no such references, as they can never be
          satisfied.
        </p><p><b>Assembler validation improvements. </b>
	  The assembler now issues a warning when a section finishes with
	  an unclosed IT instruction block at the end of the input file.
	  It also now rejects unwinding directives that appear
	  outside of a <code class="literal">.fnstart</code>/<code class="literal">.fnend</code>
	  pair.
	  Additionally, 32-bit Thumb instructions are now correctly rejected
	  when assembling for cores that do not support these instructions.
        </p><p><b>Destructor function bug fix. </b>
	  A bug in CS3 has been fixed that caused functions with the
	  <code class="literal">destructor</code> attribute not to be run on
	  program termination.
        </p><p><b>Assembler validations fix. </b>
	  A bug in the assembler that caused some <code class="literal">addw</code> and
	  <code class="literal">subw</code> instructions with SP or PC as operand to be
	  wrongly rejected has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>
         <code class="option">-mauto-it</code> assembler option replaced with
         <code class="option">-mimplicit-it</code>
       . </b>
         The <code class="option">-mauto-it</code> command-line option to the
	 assembler has been replaced with a more general
	 <code class="option">-mimplicit-it</code> option to control the behavior
	 of the assembler when conditional instructions appear outside
	 an IT instruction block. If you were previously using
	 <code class="option">-mauto-it</code>, you should now use
	 <code class="option">-mimplicit-it=always</code>.  Other
	 <code class="option">-mimplicit-it</code> modes allow you to separately
	 control implicit IT instruction insertion  behavior in ARM
	 and Thumb-2 code. For more information, refer to the
	 assembler manual.
	 In addition to renaming the option,
	 a number of bugs in the implicit IT generation have been fixed.
       </p><p><b>GDB backwards compatibility fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused GDB to crash when loading symbols
          from binaries built by very old versions of GCC.
        </p><p><b>Linker failure with Cortex-A8 erratum fix. </b>
	   A bug in the <code class="option">--fix-cortex-a8</code> linker option
	   has been fixed.  The bug caused the linker either to
	   produce a <code class="literal">bad value</code> error, or to
	   silently generate an incorrect executable. 
        </p><p><b>Debug information for variadic functions. </b>
	  A compiler bug that resulted in incorrect debug information for
	  functions with variable arguments has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Overlay sections. </b>
          <code class="command">arm-none-eabi-readelf</code> now correctly recognizes
          section headers for <code class="literal">ARM_DEBUGOVERLAY</code>
          and <code class="literal">ARM_OVERLAYSECTION</code> sections. 
        </p><p><b>Code generation improvements. </b>
	  The compiler has been changed to make better use of VFP
	  registers in mixed integer and floating-point code, resulting
	  in faster code.
	</p><p><b>Register variable corruption. </b>
          A compiler bug has been fixed that caused incorrect code to be
          generated when the frame pointer or other special-use registers
          are used as explicit local register variables, introduced via the
          <code class="literal">asm</code> keyword on their declarations.
        </p><p><b>Startup code debugging fixes. </b>
          Two GDB bugs have been fixed that caused errors when
          debugging startup code.  One bug caused an internal error
          message; the other caused the error <code class="literal">Cannot find
          bounds of current function</code>.
        </p><p><b>Assembler fix for mixed Thumb and ARM mode. </b>
          A bug in the assembler has been fixed where mapping symbols were
          sometimes incorrectly placed at section boundaries.
          This could lead to incorrect disassembly in some cases.
        </p><p><b>C++ exception matching. </b>
          A C++ conformance defect has been fixed.  According to
          clause 15.3 of the standard, given a derived class
          <code class="type">D</code> with base <code class="type">B</code>, a thrown <code class="type">D
          *</code> object is not caught by a handler with type <code class="type">B
          *&amp;</code> (that is, a reference to pointer <code class="type">B</code>).
          The compiler formerly treated this case incorrectly as if
          the handler had type <code class="type">B *</code>, which does catch
          <code class="type">D *</code>.
        </p><p><b><code class="option">-fremove-local-statics</code>
        optimization. </b>
          The <code class="option">-fremove-local-statics</code> optimization is
          now enabled by default at <code class="option">-O2</code> and higher
          optimization levels.
        </p><p><b>
	 Elimination of spurious warnings about <code class="constant">NULL</code>
        . </b>
	  The C++ compiler no longer issues spurious warnings about
	  comparisons between pointers to members and
	  <code class="constant">NULL</code>.
        </p><p><b>Vectorizer improvements. </b>
	  The compiler now generates improved code for accesses to static
	  nested array variables
	  (e.g. <code class="literal">static int foo[8][8];</code>).
        </p><p><b>Linker bug fix. </b>
          A bug that caused the linker to crash when
          <code class="literal">.ARM.exidx</code> sections were discarded by a
          linker script has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Configuration file required for Debug Sprite. </b>
          When invoking the Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite from the command line,
          it is now required to specify a board configuration file argument.
          
	  This change eliminates a source of confusion and errors resulting
	  from accidental omission of the configuration file argument, since
	  recent improvements to debugger functionality depend on properties
	  specified in the configuration file.
	  Refer to <a class="xref" href="sprite.html" title="Chapter 6. Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite">Chapter 6, &#8220;Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite&#8221;</a> for more details on invoking the
	  Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite from the command line.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.4.1. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM EABI is now based on GCC version 4.4.1.
          For more information about changes from GCC version 4.3 that was
          included in previous releases, see
          <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>Watchpoint support. </b>
          The Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite now implements watchpoints on
          all currently-supported debugging devices.
        </p><p><b>Linker map address sorting. </b>
          The map generated by the linker <code class="option">-Map</code> option
          now lists symbols sorted by address.
        </p><p><b>Assembler fix. </b>
          The assembler now correctly diagnoses a missing operand to
	  <code class="code">bl</code> and <code class="code">blx</code> instructions.
	  Previously, incorrect code was silently generated.

          A bug that caused some linker-generated functions (including
	  stubs to support interworking from ARM mode to Thumb mode and
	  stubs to avoid processor errata) to be placed in data sections
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>ARMulator support. </b>
          CS3 now includes support for using the ARMulator via the
          Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite using the RDI protocol.  
        </p><p><b>New option for automatically generating IT blocks. </b>
          The assembler now allows use of conditional Thumb-2 instructions without
          requiring explicit IT instructions.
          Use the <code class="option">-mauto-it</code> command-line option to enable this
          automatic generation of IT instructions.
        </p><p><b>Optimized <code class="function">memcpy</code>. </b>
          The Newlib implementation of <code class="function">memcpy</code> has
          been optimized to increase performance on ARM targets that
          support prefetch instructions.
        </p><p><b>Support for Cortex-M0. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite now includes support for Cortex-M0 processors.  To compile
          for these processors, use <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-m0 -mthumb</code>.
        </p><p><b>
	 Incorrect code when using <code class="option">-falign-labels</code>
        . </b>
	  A bug that caused the compiler to generate incorrect code
	  for <code class="code">switch</code> statements when the
          <code class="option">-falign-labels</code> option is used has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Reduced compilation time. </b>
	  Compilation and build times when using Sourcery G++ Lite are now
	  slightly faster.  This performance improvement is the result
	  of building the compilers and other host tools with a recent
          version of Sourcery G++, rather than an older GCC version.
        </p><p><b>Linker script load address processing. </b>
          A bug in the linker has been fixed affecting linker scripts
	  using <code class="code">AT&gt;region</code> to set the load address.
	  This now follows the documented behavior of maintaining the
	  virtual address to load address difference in output section
	  statements.  Refer to the "Output Section LMA" section of the
	  linker manual for details of how to control the load address.
        </p><p><b>Debug section placement. </b>
          A linker script bug in CS3 has been fixed that caused
	  <code class="code">.debug_ranges</code> debug sections to be misplaced.
        </p><p><b>Assembler bug fix. </b>
          A bug in the assembler that caused duplicate and missing
          mapping symbols has been fixed.  The bug caused incorrect
          <code class="command">objdump</code> output and incorrect
          byte-swapping for BE8 configurations.
        </p><p><b>Multiple flash regions. </b>
	  A bug in the CS3 linker scripts affecting boards with
	  multiple flash devices has been fixed.  The bug caused
	  initialization code to treat certain flash devices as
	  normal memory.
        </p><p><b>Stack backtracing and C++ exception handling. </b>
	  Improvements have been made to the linker in support of
	  C++ runtime exception handling and stack backtracing.
	  A problem that caused crashes during the backtrace of C routines
	  that were not compiled with the <code class="option">-fexceptions</code>
	  option has been fixed.
	  In addition, the linker generates more compact stack unwinding
	  tables which can lead to smaller executables.
        </p><p><b>Assembler floating-point format. </b>
          The assembler now defaults to VFP format for floating-point
	  numbers.  It previously defaulted to the legacy FPA format
	  if no <code class="option">-mcpu</code> or <code class="option">-march</code> option
	  was specified, or if a CPU with no floating-point unit was
	  specified.  This bug resulted in incorrect behavior of the
	  <code class="literal">.double</code> and <code class="literal">.dcb.d</code>
	  directives.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect linker-generated functions. </b>
	  A bug that caused some linker-generated functions (such as stubs
	  to support interworking from ARM mode to Thumb mode) to contain only
	  <code class="literal">nop</code> instructions instead of correct code sequences
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Assembler diagnostics for invalid instructions. </b>
	  The assembler now issues diagnostics for invalid
	  <code class="literal">ADR</code> and <code class="literal">ADRL</code> instructions.
	  Formerly, these invalid instructions were silently mis-assembled.
	  This assembler bug did not affect correct code.
	</p><p><b>Sprite's failure to reset the target. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that sometimes caused the Sourcery G++
	  Debug Sprite to fail to reset the target when using the
	  multiple sequential connection feature (enabled via the
	  <code class="option">-m</code> command-line option).  This problem was
	  specific to running the Debug Sprite on Microsoft Windows
	  hosts.
        </p><p><b>Optimized <code class="function">memcpy</code> and
	  <code class="function">memset</code> routines. </b>
          The Newlib implementations of <code class="function">memcpy</code> and
          <code class="function">memset</code> have been optimized to increase
          performance on ARM targets.
          
        </p><p><b>Loop optimization improvements. </b>
          A new option, <code class="option">-fpromote-loop-indices</code>, has
          been added to the compiler.  Specifying this option enables an
          optimization that improves the performance of loops with index
          variables of integer types narrower than the target machine
          word size, such as <code class="type">char</code> or <code class="type">short</code>.
          This optimization also applies to <code class="type">int</code> on 64-bit
          targets.
        </p><p><b>Disassembler bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect disassembly of
          some object files with multiple sections whose symbol tables
          included symbols in the middle of functions.  These
          typically resulted from hand-written assembly.
        </p><p><b><code class="literal">DMB</code>, <code class="literal">DSB</code>, and
         <code class="literal">ISB</code> instructions on ARMv6-M. </b>
          The assembler now accepts the <code class="literal">DMB</code>,
         <code class="literal">DSB</code>, and <code class="literal">ISB</code>
         instructions on ARMv6-M CPUs, including Cortex-M0 and
         Cortex-M1.  These instructions were incorrectly rejected on
	 these CPUs in previous releases.
        </p><p><b>Extraneous linker error messages. </b>
	  A linker bug that caused extraneous error messages of the form
	  <code class="code">Dwarf Error: Offset (507) greater than or equal to
	 .debug_str size (421).</code> has been corrected.  This bug did not
	 affect the correctness of output binaries.
	</p><p><b>Linker crash with very large applications. </b>
	  A linker bug that caused a crash when linking very large

        </p><p><b>Uninstaller removed by upgrade. </b>
          The uninstaller could be incorrectly deleted during an
          upgrade on Microsoft Windows hosts.  This bug has been
          fixed.
        </p><p><b>Remote debugging connection auto-retry. </b>
	  The <code class="command">target remote</code> command within GDB now uses
	  a configurable auto-retry timeout when establishing TCP connections.
	  This is useful in avoiding race conditions when the remote
	  GDB stub or GDB server is launched simultaneously with GDB.
	  The auto-retry behavior is enabled by default; refer to the

        </p><p><b><code class="literal">CMP</code> Thumb-2 instruction. </b>
	 The assembler no longer issues an error about
	 <code class="literal">CMP</code> instructions in which the second
	 argument is the stack pointer (<code class="literal">r13</code>), as
	 these are valid instructions.  However, use of the stack

        </p><p><b>Internal compiler errors when optimizing. </b>
	  A defect that occasionally caused internal compiler errors
	  when partial redundancy elimination (PRE) optimization was
	  enabled has been corrected.
        </p><p><b>Install directory pathnames. </b>
          Bugs in the install and uninstall scripts for Linux
	  
	  hosts that caused errors or incorrect behavior when the
	  Sourcery G++ install directory pathname contains whitespace
	  characters have been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler error with large NEON types. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused internal compiler errors when
          compiling code using NEON types at least 32 bytes wide.
        </p><p><b>Temporary files on Microsoft Windows. </b>
	  On Microsoft Windows hosts, Sourcery G++ Lite now uses the standard
	  Windows algorithm to choose the directory in which to place
	  temporary files.  This change eliminates a crash that
	  occurred if none of the <code class="envar">TEMP</code>,
	  <code class="envar">TMP</code>, or <code class="envar">TMPDIR</code> variables were
	  set to a suitable directory.
        </p><p><b>Vectorized shift fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect code for loops
          containing a right shift by a constant.  The bug affected
          code compiled with <code class="option">-mfpu=neon</code>
	  
	  and loop vectorization enabled with <code class="option">-O3</code> or
          <code class="option">-ftree-vectorize</code>.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect code for nested functions. </b>
	A bug in GCC that caused the compiler to generate incorrect
	code for nested functions has been fixed.  The bug resulted in
	incorrect stack alignments in the affected functions.
        </p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
	  The binutils package has been updated to version
	  2.19.51.20090205 from the FSF trunk.  This update includes
	  numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>ARM build attributes conformance improvements. </b>
          Several ARM EABI 2.07 conformance issues relating to the
          handling of build attributes in the assembler and linker have
          been fixed.  All build attribute types are now recognized,
          and can now be declared by name, in addition to by number.
          Support for merging attributes in the linker has been improved,
          and the linking of incompatible objects is now detected and
          rejected in more cases.
        </p><p><b>VFP initialization for i.MX31. </b>
	  The CS3 startup code for i.MX31 now automatically enables the
	  ARM VFP coprocessor.
	</p><p><b>Internal compiler error
        with <code class="option">-fremove-local-statics</code>. </b>
          An internal compiler error that occurred when using
          the <code class="option">-fremove-local-statics</code> option has been
          fixed.  The error occurred when compiling code with
          function-local <code class="code">static</code> array or structure
          variables.
        </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
	  6.8.50.20081022.  This update includes numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Linker crash on incompatible input files. </b>
          Some third-party compilers, including ARM <span class="trademark"> RealView</span>® 4.0, produce a
          build attribute marking output files that are not
          compatible with the ABI for the ARM Architecture.  This

          An objcopy bug that corrupted COMDAT groups when creating new
	  binaries has been fixed.  This bug also affected
	  <code class="command">strip -g</code>.
        </p><p><b>
	  Improved support for debugging <span class="trademark">
	  RealView</span>® objects
	. </b>
	  GDB support for programs compiled by the ARM <span class="trademark">RealView</span>® compiler has been
	  improved.
	</p><p><b>Binutils support for DWARF Version 3. </b>
	  The <code class="command">addr2line</code> command now supports
	  binaries containing DWARF 3 debugging information.  The
	  <code class="command">ld</code> command can display error messages
	  with source locations for input files containing DWARF 3
	  debugging information.
	</p><p><b>NEON improvements. </b>
          Several improvements and bug fixes have been made to the
          NEON Advanced SIMD Extension support in GCC.  A problem that
          caused the autovectorizer to fail in some circumstances has
          been fixed.  Also, many of the intrinsics available via the
          <code class="filename">arm_neon.h</code> header file
          now have improved error checking for out-of-bounds arguments,
          and the <code class="code">vget_lane</code> intrinsics that return signed
          values now produce improved code.
        </p><p><b>NEON compiler fix. </b>
	  A compiler bug that resulted in incorrect NEON code being
	  generated has been fixed.  Typically the incorrect code
	  occurred when NEON intrinsics were used inside small
	  <code class="code">if</code> statements.
        </p><p><b>Connecting to the target using a pipe. </b>
	  A bug in GDB's
	  <code class="command">target remote | <em class="replaceable"><code>program</code></em></code>
	  command has been fixed.  When launching the specified
	  <em class="replaceable"><code>program</code></em> failed, the bug caused
	  GDB to crash, hang, or give a message
	  <code class="literal">Error: No Error</code>.
	  
	  
	</p><p><b>Mixed-case NEON register aliases. </b>
	  An assembler bug that prevented NEON register aliases from being
	  created with mixed-case names using the <code class="code">.dn</code> and
	  <code class="code">.qn</code> directives has been fixed.  Previously only
	  aliases created with all-lowercase or all-uppercase names
	  worked correctly.
	</p><p><b>Newlib manuals. </b>
	  The documentation packaged with Sourcery G++ Lite now includes the
	  Newlib C Library and Math Library manuals.
        </p><p><b>Object file portability. </b>
          Sourcery G++ for ARM EABI can now produce object files that
          are link-compatible with the GNU C Library included with
          Sourcery G++ for ARM GNU/Linux.
          <span>
            These object files are additionally link-compatible with
            other ARM C Library ABI-compliant static linking environments
            and toolchains.
          </span>
          For additional information, refer to <a class="xref" href="portable-objects.html" title="3.7. Object File Portability">Section 3.7, &#8220;Object File Portability&#8221;</a>.
        </p><p><b>Janus 2CC support. </b>
          GCC now includes a work-around for a hardware bug in Avalent
	  Janus 2CC cores.  To compile and link for these cores, use
	  the <code class="option">-mfix-janus-2cc</code> compiler option.  If
	  you are using the linker directly use the
          <code class="option">--fix-janus-2cc</code> linker option.
        </p><p><b>ARM exception handling bug fix. </b>
	  A bug in the runtime library has been fixed that formerly
	  caused throwing an unexpected exception in C++ to crash
	  instead of calling the unexpected exception handler.  The
	  bug only affected C++ code compiled by non-GNU compilers
	  such as ARM <span class="trademark">RealView</span>®.
	</p><p><b>Simulation of programs with command-line arguments. </b>
	  When using the simulator, command-line arguments are now
	  correctly passed to the simulator program via 
	  <code class="varname">argc</code> and <code class="varname">argv</code>.
        </p><p><b>Mangling of NEON type names. </b>
	  A bug in the algorithm used by the C++ compiler for mangling
	  the names of NEON types, such as <code class="type">int8x16_t</code>, has
	  been fixed.  These mangled names are used internally in
	  object files to encode type information in addition to the
	  programmer-visible names of the C++ variables and functions.
	  The new mangled name encoding is more compact and conforms
	  to the ARM C++ ABI.
        </p><p><b>Errors after loading the debugged program. </b>
          An intermittent GDB bug has been fixed.  The bug could cause
	  a GDB internal error
	  
	  after the <code class="command">load</code> command.
        </p><p><b>Half-precision floating point. </b>
          Sourcery G++ now includes support for half-precision floating point
          via the <code class="type">__fp16</code> type in C and C++.  The compiler can
          generate code using either hardware support or library routines.
          
          For more information, see <a class="xref" href="sec-armfloat.html#sec-arm-fp16" title="3.4.3. Half-Precision Floating Point">Section 3.4.3, &#8220;Half-Precision Floating Point&#8221;</a>.

          The name of the UDMAERR (uDMA Error) interrupt vector provided by
          CS3 for Luminary Micro Stellaris configurations has been corrected.
          The correct name is <code class="function">__cs3_isr_udmaerr</code>.
        </p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
	  6.8.50.20080821.  This update adds numerous bug fixes and
	  new features, including support for decimal floating point,
	  <span>improved Thumb mode
	  support,</span> the new <code class="command">find</code> command to
	  search memory, the new <code class="option">/m</code> (mixed
	  source and assembly) option to the
	  <code class="command">disassemble</code> command, and the new
	  <code class="command">macro define</code> command to define C
	  preprocessor macros interactively.
        </p><p><b>Uppercase operands to IT instructions. </b>
	  The assembler now accepts both uppercase and lowercase operands
	  for the <code class="code">IT</code> family of instructions.
        </p><p><b>NEON autovectorizer fix. </b>
	  A compiler bug that caused generation of bad <code class="code">VLD1</code>
	  instructions has been fixed. The bug affected code compiled with
	  <code class="option">-mfpu=neon -ftree-vectorize</code>.
        </p><p><b>Bug fix in simulator reset code. </b>
	  A bug which could cause programs to crash at startup has
	  been fixed in the CS3 reset code used for simulators.  The
	  affected linker scripts are <code class="filename">generic.ld</code>,
	  <code class="filename">generic-vfp.ld</code>,
	  <code class="filename">generic-m.ld</code>,  and hosted
	  versions of the above.
        </p><p><b>Output files removed on error. </b>
	  When GCC encounters an error, it now consistently removes
	  any incomplete output files that it may have created.
        </p><p><b>Atmel AT91SAM7S-EK support. </b>
          Support for Atmel AT91SAM7S-EK boards has been added.
        </p><p><b>Placing bss-like regions in load regions. </b>
          The linker no longer issues an incorrect error message when
          a bss-like section is placed at specific load region.
          The linker formerly incorrectly considered the section as
          taking up space in the load region.
        </p><p><b>ARMv7 offset out of range errors. </b>
	  An assembler bug that resulted in
	  <code class="literal">offset out of range</code> errors when compiling for
	  ARMv7 processors has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 <code class="code">MUL</code> encoding. </b>
          In Thumb-2 mode, the assembler now encodes <code class="code">MUL</code>
          as a 16-bit instruction (rather than as a 32-bit
          instruction) when possible.  This fix results in smaller
	  code, with no loss of performance.
        </p><p><b>ARM C++ ABI utility functions. </b>
          Vector utility functions required by the ARM C++ ABI no
          longer crash when passed null pointers.  The affected
          functions are <code class="function">__aeabi_vec_dtor_cookie</code>,
          <code class="function">__aeabi_vec_delete</code>,
          <code class="function">__aeabi_vec_delete3</code>, and
          <code class="function">__aeabi_vec_delete3_nodtor</code>.  
          
	  These functions are not intended for use by application
	  programmers; they are only called by compiler-generated
	  code.  They are not presently used by the GNU C++ compiler,
	  but are used by some other compilers, including ARM's
	  <span class="trademark">RealView</span>®
	  compiler.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.3.2. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM EABI is now based on GCC version 4.3.2.
          For more information about changes from GCC version 4.2 that was
          included in previous releases, see
          <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>Smaller Thumb-2 code. </b>
          When optimizing for size (i.e., when <code class="option">-Os</code> is
	  in use), GCC now generates the 16-bit <code class="code">MULS</code>
	  Thumb-2 multiply instruction instead of the 32-bit
	  <code class="code">MUL</code> instruction.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 <code class="code">RBIT</code> encoding. </b>
	  An assembler bug that resulted in incorrect encoding of the
	  Thumb-2 <code class="code">RBIT</code> instruction has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Additional Stellaris interrupt vectors. </b>
	  The USB0, PWM3, UDMA and UDMAERR interrupt vectors have been
	  added to the CS3 Luminary Micro Stellaris configurations.
        </p><p><b>Additional Luminary Micro CPUs. </b>
          A large number of additional Luminary Micro CPUs are now
	  supported.  Linker scripts for these CPUs include the
	  internal ROM region.
        </p><p><b>Sprite communication improvements. </b>
	  The Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite now uses a more efficient protocol
	  for communicating with GDB.  This can result in less latency
	  when debugging, especially when running the Sprite on a remote
	  machine over a network connection.
        </p><p><b>Marvell Feroceon compiler bug fix. </b>
	  A bug that caused an internal compiler error when optimizing
	  for Marvell Feroceon CPUs has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Misaligned accesses to packed structures fix. </b>
          A bug that caused GCC to generate misaligned accesses to
          packed structures has been fixed.  
        </p><p><b><code class="constant">SIZE_MIN</code> and <code class="constant">SIZE_MAX</code>. </b>
	<code class="constant">SIZE_MAX</code> is now correctly defined in
	<code class="filename">stdint.h</code> to be an
	unsigned quantity equal to the maximum possible value of a
	<code class="type">size_t</code>, as required by the C standard.  In
	addition, the definition of <code class="constant">SIZE_MIN</code> has
	been removed, as this constant is not prescribed by the C
	standard.
       </p><p><b>Bug fix for objdump on Windows. </b>
          An objdump bug that caused the <code class="option">-S</code> option
          not to work on Windows in some cases has been fixed.
